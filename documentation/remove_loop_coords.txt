Procedure
1. Replace the coordinates of loop regions in the pdb with zeros by executing the command "$ROSETTA_SCRIPTS/remove_loop_coords.py loopfile.txt input.pdb output.pdb"

Timing

step 1 takes approximately 0.5 seconds per pdb file

Troubleshooting

If pdb_renumber.py terminates with an error that either the input file could not be opened, ensure that you have properly typed the file path, and that you have permission to read the file.  If an error that the output file could not be opened occurs, ensure that you have permission to write to the desired directory. 

Anticipated Results

A PDB file is produced with residues in the loop regions defined by the loop file replaced with 0 coordinates and occupancies of -1.00
