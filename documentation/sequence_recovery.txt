Procedure
1. Produce a summary of a single designed model by running $ROSETTA_SCRIPTS native.pdb designed.pdb
	a) specify --best=5 --worst=5 options to output the best and worst 5 mutations.
Timing

less than 1 second per model

Troubleshooting

Anticipated Results

The script outputs an alignment of the native and designed sequences, with * symbols indicating sequence identity. Below the alignment are the best and worst mutations by total residue score.
